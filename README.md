The driverpass project is an application that aims to give tools to indiduals to be better eqipped for every part of the licensing process for drivers. Whether its having the knowledge to pass a written exam, or honing the technique to be able to perform on the road, the program could deliver.

WE were able to really capture what the client wanted by adding systems they wanted in particular, such as the ability for specific members of the team to have certain permissions in order to stay secure. The owner wanted to have unrestricted access though. Also implementing tools to allow the service to be accessible on multiple devices is how we directly took the wants and needs of our client and turned them into what they actually wanted.

I think I would expand my use case chart. It is really lacking some obvious use cases, and its also lacking some portions that would show how certain parts borrow from others.

The proper approach would be to listen to the clients needs, ask clarifying questions, tell them what you can do for them, and have a good line of communication in the event you need to ask questions during development. As far as design, its a really good idea to have an expansive list of use cases and demonstrating how different parts borrow from others.
